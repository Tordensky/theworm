This project is meant to run at a cluster and to do this with the cf (cluster fork) command
you will in most cases need the absolute paht to run the different files, but for some cf should never be used

cellsgate.py contains the code for starting the worm gate, making it posible for the worm segmetns to actually run
on the different nodes in the cluster or just one node

to run it type:
python cellsgate.py

to run it on the cluster type:
cf python path/to/file/cellsgate.py

With the wormgate up and running it's time to start a worm segment, this is done by running the test code for one of the python
files that act as a file transfer to a random node. For this to work you MUST have a zip file named theworm.zip with all the python files in this 
project inside. These files are:
	-- cells.py (worm segment file, the one going to run on all the different nodes)
	-- deamonize.py (code for deamonizing a python process)
	-- config.py (some values used by different python files)
	-- graphics.py (runs the pygame graphics of the project)
	-- miniboid.py (contains the boids algorithm)
	-- udp.py (contains udp code for communication between worm segments)
	-- communication.py (contains code for sending and reciving files)
You can find such a zip file allready in this folder, so this can simply be used

from here simply run: 
python communication.py <random paramenter to start the file transfer> 
in the same folder the zip file is in to send the worm segment to a random node
DO NOTE that this command is not meant to be used together with the cluster fork command, but can if you want to

To kill all the worm segments simply ssh into one machine in the rocksvv cluster and run the kill.py script by typing
python kill.py
NOTE: this will not kill the worm gates
